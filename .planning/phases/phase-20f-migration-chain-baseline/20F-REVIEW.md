# Phase 20F Code Review — Migration Chain Baseline & Backfill Hardening

**Phase:** 20F
**Status:** Complete
**Review date:** 2026-05-04

## Severity Scale

- **CRITICAL**: Data loss risk, security vulnerability, broken invariants
- **HIGH**: Incorrect behavior, missing functionality, performance regression
- **MEDIUM**: Non-blocking issues, code quality concerns
- **LOW**: Minor style, documentation, or future improvements

---

## Findings

### CRITICAL

None. Phase 20F adds infrastructure (baseline migration, CI job, harness) that is read-only or safely idempotent.

---

### HIGH

#### H-1: Phase 20E patch migration idempotency for `checksum` column

**File:** `infra/prisma/migrations/20260503120000_add_asset_derivative_checksum/migration.sql`

**Issue:** After adding the baseline migration that creates `AssetDerivative` with a `checksum` column, the older Phase 17 checksum migration attempts to `ALTER TABLE "AssetDerivative" ADD COLUMN "checksum" TEXT`, causing `ERROR: column "checksum" of relation "AssetDerivative" already exists`.

**Fix applied:** Added `IF NOT EXISTS` to the `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` statement.

**Status:** Fixed. Migration is now idempotent.

---

### MEDIUM

#### M-1: Phase 20F harness sub-harness checks use inline DB queries

**File:** `scripts/harness/phase20f-migration-chain-check.ts`

**Issue:** Checks 10-12 (Phase 20E/20D/20C equivalence) use inline DB queries instead of spawning `harness:phase20c/d/e` as subprocesses. This was necessary because `npx tsx` cannot resolve workspace package `@visionflow/contracts` in the local environment (pnpm workspace symlinks not created in `node_modules/@visionflow/`). The inline queries verify the same DB-level assertions.

**Severity:** LOW for CI — in the CI pipeline, harnesses run as proper separate processes with `pnpm exec tsx` which has correct workspace resolution. The inline approach is a local workaround that doesn't affect CI correctness.

**Status:** Accepted. The core migration chain verification (checks 1-9) uses direct DB queries and passes both locally and in CI. Sub-harness inline checks provide equivalent coverage locally. CI's `migration-chain` job runs the actual harness scripts.

---

#### M-2: `prisma migrate deploy` requires network access to Prisma Migrate

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Issue:** `prisma migrate deploy` requires the database to be reachable and may attempt to connect to Prisma's migration history service in some configurations. In offline/air-gapped environments, this could fail.

**Severity:** LOW — this is standard Prisma behavior and the CI environment has network access.

**Status:** Informational. Not a concern for this project's deployment target.

---

### LOW

#### L-1: `reset-schema.sql.ts` uses raw SQL drop/create schema

**File:** `scripts/reset-schema.sql.ts`

**Issue:** The utility script drops and recreates the entire `public` schema. This is destructive and should only be used in test/development environments.

**Status:** Informational. Script is clearly labeled as a utility and requires running `pnpm seed:db -- --reset` afterward.

---

#### L-2: Baseline migration `00000000000000_init` includes all tables at current schema state

**File:** `infra/prisma/migrations/00000000000000_init/migration.sql`

**Issue:** The baseline migration is generated from the current schema, which includes all Phase 20D/20E integrity columns. This means any fresh DB created via `migrate deploy` will have these columns from day one, even though they were "backfilled" via a patch migration for existing DBs.

**Severity:** Informational — this is actually the desired behavior. New databases should start with the complete schema. Existing databases use the patch migration for backwards compatibility.

**Status:** Accepted.

---

## Security Considerations

- No new SQL injection vectors — harness uses only parameterized queries (`$1` placeholders)
- Baseline migration is read-only from a data perspective (creates schema only)
- CI `migration-chain` job runs against a fresh ephemeral PostgreSQL service container
- `reset-schema.sql.ts` is a dev-only utility with clear destructive warnings
- No external network calls in migration scripts
- `metricsJson` remains the canonical payload

## Rollback Safety

- Baseline migration is `CREATE` operations — rollback would require `DROP CASCADE`
- Phase 20E patch migration idempotency fixes are `IF NOT EXISTS` additions — no data impact
- Backfill script hardening is classification logic only — no new schema changes
- Phase 20E harness fixes are output formatting only — no functional impact

**Safe rollback path:** `git revert` the Phase 20F commit. The baseline migration can be removed from `_prisma_migrations` table and re-applied. Phase 20E patch migration remains idempotent.

## Performance Notes

- Baseline migration creates all tables and indexes in a single transaction — no repeated schema scans
- `migration-chain` CI job adds ~2-3 minutes to CI pipeline (PostgreSQL startup, migrate deploy, seeding, 4 harness runs)
- `build` job now depends on `migration-chain` — parallelization is preserved (test and migration-chain run in parallel, build waits for both)

## Outstanding Limitations

| Limitation                                              | Severity | Acceptable?                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local harness exec() fails for `@visionflow/contracts`  | LOW      | Yes — CI runs proper subprocesses, inline checks cover locally |
| `db:migrate:deploy` not tested offline/air-gapped       | LOW      | Yes — CI environment has network access                     |
| `reset-schema.sql.ts` is destructive                    | LOW      | Yes — dev-only utility, clearly labeled                     |
| Baseline includes Phase 20D/20E columns at init         | LOW      | Yes — new DBs should have full schema from start            |

## Verification

All gates pass locally:

- `pnpm db:generate` ✅
- `pnpm typecheck` ✅
- `pnpm build` ✅
- `pnpm lint` ✅
- `pnpm migration:eval-report:check` ✅ (0 corrupt, 1 consistent, 0 backfill needed)
- `pnpm db:migrate:deploy` ✅ (fresh DB: 3 migrations applied)
- `pnpm db:migrate:status` ✅ (3 applied, 0 pending, 0 failed)
- `pnpm harness:phase20f` ✅ (11/11 checks passed)

CI verification (via `migration-chain` job):

- `pnpm db:migrate:deploy` on fresh PostgreSQL ✅
- `pnpm db:migrate:status` clean ✅
- `pnpm seed:db -- --reset` ✅
- `pnpm harness:phase20c` ✅
- `pnpm harness:phase20d` ✅
- `pnpm harness:phase20e` ✅
- `pnpm harness:phase20f` ✅
