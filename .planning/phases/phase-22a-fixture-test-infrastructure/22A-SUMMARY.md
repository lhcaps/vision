# Phase 22A — Fixture & Test Infrastructure Summary

## Status: PASS

**Date:** 2026-05-05

## What Was Built

### Fixture Contract Module
- **Location:** `scripts/fixtures/visionflow-fixtures.ts`
- **Purpose:** Single source of truth for all canonical demo IDs used across seed, harnesses, and smoke commands
- **Exports:** `FIXTURE_IDS` — project, dataset, datasetVersion, annotationWorkspace, assets, pipeline, modelArtifact, inferenceJob, evaluation, annotations, predictions, labels
- **Usage:** Importable by seed-db.ts, harnesses, and future Phase 22B tests

### Fixture Infrastructure Harness
- **Location:** `scripts/harness/phase22a-fixture-infrastructure-check.ts`
- **Checks:** 19 read-only DB integrity assertions
- **Strict mode:** Exits 1 if DATABASE_URL absent or any check fails
- **Phases verified:** Project existence, LOCKED dataset version, asset links, MANUAL annotations, pipeline/model references, SUCCEEDED job, predictions, evaluation report consistency, stale job check, Phase 20D/20E/20F equivalence

### Meta-Harness Aggregator
- **Location:** `scripts/harness/phase22a-meta-harness.ts`
- **Purpose:** Runs Phase 22A fixture check + phase20c + phase20d + phase20e + phase20f in sequence
- **Reports:** Per-harness pass/fail with duration
- **Exit:** Non-zero if any harness fails

### CI Wiring
- **db-harness:** Added `pnpm harness:phase22a` after seed reset
- **migration-chain:** Added `pnpm harness:phase22a` after seed reset
- **No harnesses removed:** phase20c/20d/20e/20f all preserved

## Architecture Decisions

### Fixture contract location
`scripts/fixtures/visionflow-fixtures.ts` — module-level TypeScript constants, not a separate package. Single file, no build step, directly importable by tsx scripts.

### Harness location
`scripts/harness/phase22a-fixture-infrastructure-check.ts` — follows existing phase20c/20d/20e/20f naming pattern. Inline Prisma queries, no exec to avoid workspace symlink issues.

### Meta-harness: yes, small scope
Justified because: it cleanly orchestrates 5 harnesses, reports rollup result, does not hide individual failures, avoids long-running services. Not justified as a full orchestrator with Docker Compose management.

### Strict mode
Both harness and meta-harness exit non-zero on failure in `--strict` mode. CI uses `--strict`. Developer without DATABASE_URL sees informative SKIP message.

## Known Limitations

- Phase 22A does not create deterministic image/video fixtures (Phase 22B scope)
- Phase 22A does not create Docker test-stack.yml (Phase 22B scope)
- Fixture contract does not include MINIO asset storage keys (seed-db.ts uses deterministic `originals/{assetId}/{name}` and `thumbnails/{assetId}/{name}` patterns)
- Meta-harness requires DATABASE_URL to run any harness — no partial pass when DB is absent
