# Phase 22A — Fixture & Test Infrastructure Review

## Code Review Findings

### Severity: Informational

**Fixture contract (`scripts/fixtures/visionflow-fixtures.ts`):**
- Constants are `as const` — no accidental mutation
- Exported as a typed `FixtureIds` for TypeScript consumers
- Does not duplicate seed logic — imports nothing, only exports facts
- `metricsHash` value `da3bb6d0b4b3d8c1` is a known/expected value computed from the seeded report. If the report ever changes, this will need updating. Currently consistent with Phase 20C/20D/20E state.

**Fixture harness (`scripts/harness/phase22a-fixture-infrastructure-check.ts`):**
- Uses `PrismaClient` with `log: []` — no noisy output
- Strict mode: exits 1 if DATABASE_URL absent — correct for CI
- All checks are read-only — no mutations
- Prisma disconnects in finally blocks — correct
- Check 9 (pipeline model reference): defensive — handles missing yolo_onnx node gracefully
- Check 15 (row vs JSON consistency): uses `Math.abs(r.iouThreshold - mjIou) < 0.001` for floating-point comparison — appropriate
- Inline Phase 20D/20E/20F equivalence checks — avoids exec overhead while maintaining harness coverage

**Meta-harness (`scripts/harness/phase22a-meta-harness.ts`):**
- Uses `execSync` with `stdio: 'inherit'` — harnesses print directly to CI log — good visibility
- Exit code captured from caught error — `status` field, not `signal`
- No shell hiding — failures surface clearly
- Does not shell to Docker or long-running services — correct
- Runs in sequence (not parallel) — correct because harnesses share the same DB

**CI wiring (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**
- `harness:phase22a` added after `seed:db -- --reset` in both db-harness and migration-chain — correct placement
- Existing phase20c/20d/20e/20f all preserved — no weakening
- DATABASE_URL set for each harness step — correct
- No Docker Compose added — correct (PostgreSQL service is sufficient for fixture harness)

**package.json:**
- Scripts use `--strict` flag — correct for CI
- Both `harness:phase22a` and `meta:harness:phase22a` added

## Testing

- Phase 22A fixture harness was run with a seeded database and passed all 19 checks
- Meta-harness runs all 5 harnesses (phase22a + phase20c/20d/20e/20f) in sequence
- No phase20 harness was weakened or removed

## Recommendations for Phase 22B

1. Import `FIXTURE_IDS` from `scripts/fixtures/visionflow-fixtures.ts` instead of hard-coding IDs
2. Use `pnpm harness:phase22a` as a prerequisite in CI before running production-path tests
3. When creating integration tests, reset the DB with `seed:db -- --reset` to ensure fixture IDs are stable
4. Phase 22B smoke commands can use IDs from `FIXTURE_IDS` directly

## Conclusion

Phase 22A delivers on its goal: deterministic fixture infrastructure that is minimal, correct, and non-disruptive. No product code was changed. No harnesses were weakened. The phase sets a clean foundation for Phase 22B production-path tests.
