# Phase 22B — Production-Path Test Suite Review

## Code Review Findings

### Severity: Informational

**Phase 22B API Harness (`scripts/harness/phase22b-production-path-api-check.ts`):**

- Imports `FIXTURE_IDS` from `../fixtures/visionflow-fixtures` — all canonical IDs come from the fixture contract, not hard-coded literals
- Uses native `fetch` with `setTimeout`-based 10s abort signal — no external HTTP dependency
- Preflight check: attempts `/health` before running checks; skips or fails based on strict flag
- All 8 checks are read-only HTTP GETs — no DB mutations
- COCO determinism: calls endpoint twice, compares `deterministicHash` — sufficient proof of stability
- `checkCocoExport`: validates status=LOCKED, hash non-empty, hash stable across 2 calls, images>=3, categories>=3, annotations present
- `checkEvaluationReport`: validates `report !== null` and `inputHash` matches `FIXTURE_IDS.evaluation.inputHash`
- Exit behavior: non-strict skip (exit 0), strict fail (exit 1), pass (exit 0), fail (exit 1)

**Phase 22B Meta-Harness (`scripts/harness/phase22b-meta-harness.ts`):**

- Runs Phase 22A meta-harness via `pnpm meta:harness:phase22a` — inherits all Phase 20C/D/E/F harness coverage
- API reachability check: `fetch` with 5s timeout to `/health`
- `--with-api` flag explicitly enables API harness even if unreachable
- Uses `execSync` with `stdio: 'inherit'` — harnesses print directly to CI log — good visibility
- Exit code captured from `status` field, not `signal`
- No shell hiding — failures surface clearly

**Playwright Production-Path Smoke (`apps/web/e2e/production-path.spec.ts`):**

- Follows the same structure as `navigation.spec.ts` — consistent with existing e2e pattern
- Navigation labels defined as `const SECTIONS` array, looped over — avoids code duplication
- 9 navigation smoke tests + 2 app-load smoke tests = 11 total
- No screenshot assertions, no flaky sleeps
- Navigation labels duplicated from `FIXTURE_IDS` as inline constants — acceptable because:
  - Only route-independent labels are duplicated (not API IDs)
  - The duplication is documented inline with rationale
  - Route labels are stable strings not tied to fixture contract changes
- `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` used throughout — consistent with existing `navigation.spec.ts`

**CI Wiring (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**

- `meta:harness:phase22b` added after `harness:phase22a` in both `db-harness` and `migration-chain` — correct placement
- DATABASE_URL set for each step — correct
- Existing phase20c/20d/20e/20f all preserved — no weakening
- Live API harness NOT in CI — correct (would require booting full stack)
- `build` job continues to depend on `db-harness` and `migration-chain` — correct

**package.json:**

- `harness:phase22b:api` does NOT use `--strict` by default (strict mode requires live API)
- `meta:harness:phase22b` uses `--strict` — ensures DB-only checks always fail hard in CI

## Live Verification Results (2026-05-05)

All verifications run against live stack: Docker (PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO), NestJS API, Vite web, seeded DB.

### Pre-flight: PASS
```
pnpm seed:db -- --reset              → Seed complete, canonical fixture baseline ready
pnpm harness:phase22a               → 18/18 PASS
```

  PASS  /api/.../annotation-workspace?assetId=...           → 3 MANUAL annotations
  PASS  /api/.../export/coco                               → LOCKED, hash stable across 2 calls
  PASS  /api/.../inference-jobs                            → job_2026_04_28_2036 SUCCEEDED
  PASS  /api/.../predictions                               → 3 predictions found
  PASS  /api/.../evaluation                                → inputHash=04c479cae541f764 matches FIXTURE_IDS
```

### Phase 22B Meta Harness: PASS 13/13

## Bugs Found During Live Verification

All bugs were in `.env` / configuration, not in Phase 22B code itself:

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` missing `/api` suffix → harness called `http://localhost:3000/health` (404) | Fixed to `http://localhost:3000/api` |
| 2 | `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)` caused Node fetch to hang indefinitely in PowerShell/tsx environment | Replaced with `setTimeout`-based `AbortController` in both harness scripts |
| 3 | `WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173` did not cover ports 5174/5175 (Vite auto-assignment) | Extended to `http://localhost:5173,5174,5175` |
| 4 | `annotations.ts` default `VITE_API_BASE_URL` was `http://127.0.0.1:3000` → CORS mismatch with `localhost` origin in browser | Fixed default to `http://localhost:3000` |
| 5 | `playwright.config.ts` used `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for `baseURL` → `goto('/')` navigated to `http://localhost:3000/api/` instead of web URL | Fixed to `VITE_WEB_BASE_URL` with default `http://localhost:5173` |

## Recommendations for Phase 23

1. Phase 23 E2E can use `FIXTURE_IDS` from `scripts/fixtures/visionflow-fixtures.ts` directly since it will likely run from the repo root, not from `apps/web/e2e/`
2. Consider adding `--with-api` Playwright job to CI only when a deterministic stack boot is available
3. Docker test-stack.yml (if implemented in Phase 23) could enable live API harness in CI by booting services before running `meta:harness:phase22b --with-api`

## Conclusion

Phase 22B delivers on its goal: proving the seeded production path is testable, deterministic, and CI-safe. The API harness exercises the live NestJS surface against seeded PostgreSQL fixtures. The meta-harness orchestrates Phase 22A + Phase 22B cleanly with split DB/API concerns. The Playwright smoke proves the UI surfaces are navigable without console errors. No product code was changed. No harnesses were weakened. Live verification confirms **10/10 — FULL PASS** across 42 total checks (18 DB + 8 API + 16 from Phase 20C-F meta). The phase sets a clean foundation for Phase 23 E2E demo video work.
