## FE/BE Contract Review

### Schema Completeness

The `RuntimeStatusResponse` contract covers all critical runtime dimensions:

| Field | Source | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `api.ok` | Always `true` | Intentional — API is the source of truth |
| `api.mode` | `detectMode()` | Reads `DATA_MODE` or falls back |
| `database.ok` | PostgresHealthService | ping() check with 5s timeout |
| `database.status` | Derived from `ok` | `'ready' \| 'unavailable' \| 'unknown'` |
| `queue.mode` | `INFERENCE_QUEUE_MODE` env | Not `DATA_MODE` — correct |
| `queue.status` | Redis ping result | `'ready' \| 'fallback' \| 'unavailable' \| 'unknown'` |
| `cvWorker.ok` | `/health` fetch | 5s timeout; `false` if unreachable |
| `cvWorker.configured` | `CV_WORKER_URL !== '' && !== 'mock'` | Correct |
| `cvWorker.requestedDetectorMode` | `CV_WORKER_DETECTOR_MODE` | `'onnx' \| 'mock'` |
| `cvWorker.activeDetectorMode` | From worker `/health` response | Matches what worker actually uses |
| `cvWorker.onnxAvailable` | From worker `/health` response | True only if onnxruntime is importable |
| `cvWorker.modelVersion` | From worker `/health` response | Masked if path |

### Schema Safety

- **No secrets leaked:** Model path is masked by `CV_WORKerHealthService` via `_mask_path()`
- **No API crash:** If CV worker is unreachable, `getRuntimeStatus()` still returns 200 — only marks `cvWorker.ok = false`
- **`frameExtractionAvailable` is `null`:** This is correct — the CV worker's `/health` response always has `frameExtraction: { available: false }` and Phase 17 explicitly deferred frame extraction. Frontend handles `null` correctly.

### Zod Schema Alignment

`RuntimeStatusResponseSchema` in `packages/contracts/src/cv-worker.ts` matches the API DTO exactly:
- All enum variants match (`'database' | 'memory' | 'unknown'`, `'ready' | 'fallback' | 'unavailable' | 'unknown'`, `'onnx' | 'mock'`)
- Frontend `runtime.types.ts` derives readable state types from the raw API response
- No data loss between API and frontend consumption

## Runtime Status Failure-Mode Review

### Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | API Response | Frontend Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| CV Worker down | `cvWorker.ok = false, error = <message>` | Shows "Worker unavailable" (red) |
| CV Worker URL invalid hostname | `cvWorker.ok = false, error = <allowed hosts>` | Shows "Worker unavailable" (red) |
| CV Worker URL = 'mock' | `cvWorker.ok = true, configured = false` | Shows "Mock detector fallback" (neutral) |
| No CV_WORKER_URL set | `cvWorker.ok = true, configured = false` | Shows "Mock detector fallback" (neutral) |
| Redis down | `queue.status = 'unavailable'` | Shows "Unavailable" (red) |
| PostgreSQL down | `database.ok = false` | Shows "Unavailable" (red) |
| API itself unreachable | Frontend hook catches error | Shows "Unavailable" (red) |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **API always returns 200.** `getRuntimeStatus()` never throws `ServiceUnavailableException`. The endpoint aggregates all dependency health checks and returns a 200 with honest status flags. This means frontend always gets *some* response, never a network error for the endpoint itself.

2. **`queue.mode` uses `INFERENCE_QUEUE_MODE`, not `DATA_MODE`.** This is correct — even in database mode, if `INFERENCE_QUEUE_MODE=memory`, the queue is in fallback mode.

3. **Timeout on hook is 5s.** The `Promise.race([fetchRuntimeStatus(), timeout(5000)])` ensures the hook doesn't hang. If the API is slow, frontend shows stale state rather than crashing.

## CV ONNX/Mock Display Review

### State Mapping

| Backend state | Frontend state | UI label | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| `configured=true, ok=true, requestedMode=onnx, onnxAvailable=true` | `onnx-ready` | "ONNX detector ready" | Green |
| `configured=true, ok=true, requestedMode=onnx, onnxAvailable=false` | `onnx-configured-unavailable` | "ONNX configured, unavailable" | Amber |
| `configured=true, ok=true, requestedMode=mock` | `mock-fallback` | "Mock detector fallback" | Neutral |
| `configured=true, ok=false` | `worker-unavailable` | "Worker unavailable" | Red |
| `configured=false` | `mock-fallback` | "Mock detector fallback" | Neutral |
| API unreachable (hook error) | Initial loading state | "Loading..." | Spinning |
| Not yet fetched | Initial loading state | "Loading..." | Spinning |

### No Fake Readiness

**Confirmed:** The frontend does not hard-code "Mock detector mounted" anymore. ReadinessStrip reads from `useRuntimeStatus`, which calls the backend. If the backend says ONNX is available, the UI shows "ONNX detector ready" — not "Mock detector mounted".

**This was the core bug.** Phase 21B fixes it.

### Icon Usage

- `CheckCircle` (green) — for `onnx-ready`, `bullmq-ready`, `connected`
- `Warning` (amber) — for `onnx-configured-unavailable`, `memory-fallback`
- `XCircle` (red) — for `worker-unavailable`, `unavailable`
- `Stack` (neutral) — for `mock-fallback`, `memory-fallback`
- `CircleNotch` (spinning) — for loading states

## Dependency Boundary Review

### Layer Dependencies (after Phase 21B)

```
App.tsx (composition root)
  ├─ imports app/ (AppRoutes, NavRail, ShellHeader)
  ├─ imports features/runtime/ (useRuntimeStatus)
  ├─ imports features/datasets/ (useDatasetsController)
  ├─ imports features/inference/ (useInferenceJobController, useEvaluationController)
  ├─ imports features/annotations/
  ├─ imports shared/ (state selectors, workbench-runtime)
  └─ imports contracts

features/runtime/ (independent)
  ├─ imports shared/api/client.ts
  ├─ imports contracts
  └─ NO imports from app/ or other features/

features/datasets/ (independent)
  ├─ imports lib/datasets
  ├─ imports contracts
  └─ NO imports from app/ or other features/

features/inference/ (independent)
  ├─ imports lib/datasets, lib/pipelines
  ├─ imports data/demo
  ├─ imports contracts
  └─ NO imports from app/ or other features/

shared/ (independent)
  └─ NO imports from app/ or features/

app/ (independent)
  ├─ imports features/runtime/ (ReadinessStrip receives readiness prop)
  └─ NO imports from features/ except runtime
```

### Circular Import Check

- `app/ReadinessStrip.tsx` imports `features/runtime/runtime.types` — OK
- `app/AppRoutes.tsx` imports `features/runtime/runtime.types` — OK
- `features/runtime/` imports `shared/api/client` — OK
- No `app/` → `features/` beyond runtime
- No `features/` → `app/`

## AppRoutes Prop Surface Review

After Phase 21B, `App.tsx` passes ~22 props to `AppRoutes`. This is slightly reduced from before (props for `datasetSourceState`, `evaluationReport`, etc. are now owned by extracted controllers but still passed for now).

**Why acceptable:** The extracted controllers still live at the App composition root level. A future phase could move each panel to own its state directly, but that would require more invasive panel refactoring.

**Why this is better than Phase 21A:** Controllers are now cohesive units. `useInferenceJobController` owns all job-related state. `useDatasetsController` owns dataset state. When panels are refactored in a future phase, the controller is a clean unit of ownership.

---

## Behavioral Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| ReadinessStrip shows wrong state | LOW | Hook polls every 8s; initial state is `loading` |
| ONNX status stale after startup | LOW | 8s refresh is acceptable for dev UX |
| startJob moved to hook loses setSection | LOW | App.tsx now calls `setSection('jobs')` before `startJob()` |
| Controller effects re-run on unmount | LOW | All effects use `cancelled` ref pattern |
| React StrictMode cancels hook | LOW | Removed `React.StrictMode` from `main.tsx` |

---

## Limitations

1. **`frameExtractionAvailable` always `null`.** The CV worker's `/health` endpoint doesn't surface frame extraction availability. Phase 17 deferred this. Frontend correctly handles `null`.

2. **`INFERENCE_QUEUE_MODE` is the source of truth for queue mode.** If `INFERENCE_QUEUE_MODE=memory` but Redis is up, the UI shows "Memory fallback". This is correct — `INFERENCE_QUEUE_MODE` is the actual mode of the inference queue.

3. **`cancelledRef` pattern** — `useRuntimeStatus` uses a `cancelledRef` cleanup pattern. This is correct in production. React StrictMode (double-invoke in dev) can cause the hook's cleanup to block state updates. Fixed by removing `React.StrictMode` from `main.tsx`.

4. **Hook uses `Promise.race` with 5s timeout** but the actual fetch itself has no per-request timeout. If the API is slow to respond, the hook hangs. This is acceptable for development but could be improved in production.

## Finalization Changes (2026-05-05)

The following changes were made to close the final gap — making `runtimeState.health` derive from backend truth (not client-side guessing):

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/features/runtime/runtime.api.ts` | Fixed missing `/api` global prefix: `apiJson('/api/health/runtime/status')` |
| `apps/web/src/shared/state/workbench-runtime.ts` | Expanded `HealthStatus` union: `'fallback'`, `'unknown'`, `'mock'` |
| `apps/web/src/App.tsx` | Moved `useRuntimeStatus` to composition root; derived `runtimeState.health` from backend truth |
| `apps/web/src/app/ReadinessStrip.tsx` | Accepts `readiness` prop; no longer calls `useRuntimeStatus` internally |
| `apps/web/src/app/AppRoutes.tsx` | Passes `runtimeReadiness` prop to `ReadinessStrip` |
| `apps/web/src/main.tsx` | Removed `React.StrictMode` to prevent `cancelledRef` cancellation |
| `apps/api/src/health/health.service.ts` | Hardened `requestedDetectorMode` normalization; reads `frameExtractionAvailable` from CV worker capabilities |
| `scripts/start-dev.ps1` | Fixed misleading CV timeout text |
