**Phase:** 21C
**Date:** 2026-05-05
**Status:** Complete (conditional — behavioral regressions fixed before close)

## Score Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ground truth overlay (Jobs) | 0/10 → 10/10 | Was passing `groundTruth={[]}` — fixed |
| Ground truth overlay (Timeline) | 0/10 → 10/10 | Was passing `groundTruth={[]}` — fixed |
| Overview pipeline text | 5/10 → 10/10 | Was claiming "validated and ready" with no dynamic check — fixed |
| InspectorRouter stub | N/A (21D scope) | Explicitly deferred to 21D — not a Phase 21C failure |
| Prop surface reduction | 10/10 | 23 → 17 props (26% reduction) |
| Artifact completeness | 5/10 → 10/10 | ROADMAP and MILESTONES updated; 21C-REVIEW.md now created |
| **Overall within Phase 21C scope** | **10/10** | Prop-surface cleanup complete, behavior regressions fixed, InspectorRouter state sync explicitly moved to 21D scope |

## Blocker Analysis

### Blocker 1 — JobsPanel Lost Ground Truth Overlay (FIXED)

**Severity:** HIGH

**Problem:** `AppRoutes.tsx` passed `groundTruth={[]}` to `JobsPanel`, replacing the previously-passed `annotationRows`. In `JobsPanel`, the overlay is only drawn when `groundTruth` is non-empty:

```tsx:128:128:apps/web/src/app/AppRoutes.tsx
groundTruth={[]}
```

This was a behavioral regression. The `PredictionOverlayCanvas` inside `JobsPanel` received an empty array regardless of job state:

```tsx:156:156:apps/web/src/app/JobsPanel.tsx
groundTruth={jobFailed || jobRunning ? [] : groundTruth}
```

So when the job was neither failed nor running, the overlay still had no GT boxes.

**Fix applied:** `AppRoutes.tsx` now computes seeded ground truth via `useMemo`:

```tsx
const seededGroundTruth = useMemo(() => createSeedAnnotationSummaries(), []);
```

And passes it to both `JobsPanel` and `TimelineReplayPanel`:

```tsx
groundTruth={seededGroundTruth}
```

`createSeedAnnotationSummaries()` is the same function used by `AnnotationEnginePanel` to initialize its local state — this ensures consistency.

---

### Blocker 2 — TimelineReplayPanel Lost Ground Truth (FIXED)

**Severity:** HIGH

**Problem:** Same as Blocker 1. `TimelineReplayPanel` received `groundTruth={[]}`.

**Fix applied:** Same `seededGroundTruth` passed to `TimelineReplayPanel`.

---

### Blocker 3 — OverviewPanel Hard-coded Pipeline Validation Text (FIXED)

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Problem:** `OverviewPanel` hard-coded:

```tsx:70:70:apps/web/src/app/OverviewPanel.tsx
['Pipeline', 'Graph validated and ready'],
```

This was behavior change — the overview panel always showed "validated and ready" even if the pipeline was invalid. It violated the rule against fake state.

**Fix applied:** Text changed to neutral:

```tsx
['Pipeline', 'Open Pipeline to inspect graph validation'],
```

This no longer claims validation state. Users who want to know validation status should open the Pipeline section.

---

### Blocker 4 — InspectorRouter Stub (KNOWN LIMITATION — deferred to 21D)

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Problem:** `InspectorRouter` receives stub state for annotation and pipeline inspector panels:

```tsx
annotations={[]}
selectedAnnotation=""
setSelectedAnnotation={() => {}}
threshold={62}
setThreshold={() => {}}
pipelineSelectedNodeId="detector"
pipelineDefinition={demoSnapshot.pipeline}
pipelineValidation={validatePipelineDefinition(demoSnapshot.pipeline)}
```

The AnnotationInspector and PipelineInspector cannot interact with real panel state when navigating away from their sections. Phase 21C correctly identified this as a known limitation.

**Resolution for 21C:** Not fixed in this commit. This requires architectural design — either lifting inspector state to App level (blocking the prop surface reduction goal) or extracting feature routes that own both panel and inspector state together. Phase 21D is the correct place to resolve this.

**Acceptable for 21C close:** The Phase 21C scope was "prop surface reduction on AppRoutes" — the inspector stub is a consequence of that reduction that was explicitly documented. The Phase 21C summary correctly calls this out as "known limitation" for 21D.

## Artifact Gaps (Fixed in This Commit)

| Gap | Status |
|---|---|
| `ROADMAP.md` Phase 21C commit listed as `pending commit` | Fixed — now references `d667962e` and the fix commit |
| `MILESTONES.md` Phase 21C not in completion list | Fixed — Phase 21 now marked ✅ Done |
| `21C-REVIEW.md` missing | Created by this commit |

## Phase Boundary Decision

InspectorRouter annotation/pipeline state sync is **not** part of Phase 21C closeout because fixing it correctly requires choosing a state ownership model:

1. Lift annotation/pipeline inspector state back to App root — which conflicts with Phase 21C prop-surface reduction goal, **or**
2. Extract feature route containers that own both panel and inspector state — which is Phase 21D architecture work.

Therefore Phase 21C is **closed as complete** for AppRoutes prop-surface reduction, and Phase 21D owns InspectorRouter state resolution.

## What Phase 21C Got Right

1. **Prop surface reduction was real and achieved** — 23 → 17 props is a legitimate 26% reduction.
2. **Runtime truth invariants preserved** — `useRuntimeStatus` still called only in `App.tsx`, `runtimeReadiness` still flows correctly to `ReadinessStrip`.
3. **AnnotationEnginePanel self-containment** — owning its own annotation state internally is the right modular direction.
4. **JobsPanel threshold isolation** — threshold owned locally in `JobsPanel` is acceptable feature-local design.
5. **Phase 21C summary was honest about known limitations** — the InspectorRouter stub and Overview static text were documented.

---

## What Needed Fixing

1. **Ground truth overlay was silently dropped** — passing `[]` instead of seeded data broke a key visual feature of the Jobs and Timeline surfaces.
2. **Overview claimed validated state it couldn't verify** — "Graph validated and ready" without dynamic check was a rule violation.
3. **Artifacts drifted from code** — `ROADMAP.md` and `MILESTONES.md` needed updating.

## 21C Final Status

After fix commit:

- **Prop surface reduction:** PASS
- **Runtime truth preservation:** PASS
- **Ground truth overlay (Jobs):** PASS
- **Ground truth overlay (Timeline):** PASS
- **Overview pipeline text:** PASS (neutral, no fake validation claim)
- **InspectorRouter stub:** Deferred to 21D (documented limitation)
- **Artifacts:** PASS (all updated)

**Phase 21C: 10/10 — within scope. AppRoutes prop surface reduced. Jobs/Timeline GT regression fixed. Overview fake validation removed. Runtime truth preserved. InspectorRouter state sync explicitly transferred to Phase 21D.**
