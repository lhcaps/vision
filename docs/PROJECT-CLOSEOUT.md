# VisionFlow Studio — v1.1 Project Closeout

## Status

VisionFlow Studio v1.1 is closed as an **engineering-complete milestone**.

The project is temporarily closed in its current form because the core technical proof has been completed: full-stack architecture, deterministic fixtures, production-path API harnesses, runtime truth integration, and browser-level Playwright verification.

This does not mean the project is abandoned. Future development is intentionally deferred into later version lines instead of being treated as unfinished v1.1 debt.

## Current Classification

| Area                  | Status                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Engineering proof     | Complete                               |
| Product prototype proof | Complete                             |
| Portfolio readiness   | Mostly complete                        |
| Demo media            | Deferred                               |
| Production SaaS readiness | Out of scope                     |

VisionFlow should currently be understood as a **local/private computer vision workbench prototype** with production-style engineering boundaries. It is not yet a public SaaS product.

## Completed Scope

VisionFlow v1.1 includes:

- Media ingestion
- Dataset versioning
- Locked dataset versions
- Annotation workspace
- Visual pipeline builder
- Async inference orchestration
- CV worker integration
- ONNX/mock detector path
- Prediction overlay
- Evaluation reports
- COCO export
- Timeline replay
- Dataset diff
- Runtime health/readiness truth
- Deterministic seed fixtures
- Database integrity harnesses
- Production-path API harnesses
- Full vertical-slice Playwright proof

## What This Project Proves

VisionFlow demonstrates:

- Full-stack system architecture
- React application composition
- NestJS API design
- Prisma/PostgreSQL modeling
- Redis/BullMQ async workflow
- MinIO object storage integration
- FastAPI CV worker integration
- Deterministic evaluation logic
- Runtime health synchronization
- Test harness discipline
- Playwright browser verification
- Long-phase project execution and closeout discipline

The project is strong enough to represent advanced portfolio-level engineering work.

## Intentionally Out of Scope

The following are not part of v1.1:

- Authentication and RBAC
- Public cloud deployment
- Multi-user collaboration
- Production-grade tenancy
- Model training
- Large-scale dataset management
- Full production security posture
- Committed demo GIF/video artifact

These are future productization tasks, not blockers for v1.1 closeout.

## Future Development Roadmap

### v1.2 — Engineering Polish

Potential next work:

- Full mutation E2E flow: upload → annotate → lock → COCO export → inference → evaluation
- More stable `data-testid` coverage for Playwright
- Hook-level extraction from `App.tsx`
- Real frame extraction for video assets
- Demo GIF/MP4 recording and README embed
- Cleaner local production-mode Docker profile

### v1.3 — Product Hardening

Potential next work:

- Authentication and RBAC
- Multi-project workflows
- Dataset search, filtering, and bulk actions
- Model registry and detector versioning
- Better error recovery UX
- Batch annotation workflow
- Improved import/export tooling

### v1.4 — Deployment & Operations

Potential next work:

- Cloud deployment guide
- Production Docker Compose profile
- Observability dashboard
- Backup and restore workflow
- User/project permissions
- CI live-stack job for API + web + CV worker

### Long-Term AI/CV Expansion

Potential next work:

- Active learning loop
- Model training pipeline
- Segmentation mask support
- Video dataset workflows
- Detector plugin architecture
- Team collaboration and review workflow

## Final Closeout Statement

VisionFlow Studio v1.1 is complete as an engineering milestone.

Future work should be treated as a new version line, not unfinished v1.1 debt. The current project state is suitable for technical review, portfolio presentation, and future extension.
